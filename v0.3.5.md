This is targeted to the now-current VSCode 1.103+ over Windows, but has not
been tested with prior VSCode versions or other operating systems.

Yes, that means the extension should not be built with an older version, and especially that it cannot be run with an older version. This needs to be worked out. If you **need** to use an older version of VSCode, please explain why in a repo Issue.

## Change Log

### v0.3.5.1 Alpha (2025-09-03)

- Rebuilt with latest dependencies for latest VSCode 1.103+.
- Fixes issue with production 0.2.8 that doesn't allow connection from current VSCode.

## Dependency Updates

Some dependencies have been updated - some have not. Some are old and should be replaced. Please do not report old dependencies simply because there is (or is not) an update available. Only report functional issues that are due to specific dependency problems or that absolutely require an update. Dependencies will be updated as they are verified.
