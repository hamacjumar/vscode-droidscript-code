# DroidScript - Create Android Apps Using JavaScript

![Overview](./images/main-ss.png)

[DroidScript](https://droidscript.org/) is an easy to use, portable coding tool which simplifies android app development. It dramatically improves productivity by speeding up development by as much as 10x compared with using the standard development tools.

It’s also an ideal tool for learning JavaScript, you can literally code anywhere with DroidScript, it’s not cloud based and doesn’t require an internet connection.

Unlike other development tools which take hours to install and eat up gigabytes of disk space, you can install DroidScript in your phone and start using it within 30 seconds!

### Download DroidScript app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartphoneremote.androidscriptfree)

## Extension Requirements

* You should have DroidScript app installed in your phone.
* The phone and this laptop/desktop should be connected to the same WiFi network.

> For version 0.2.7 and above, the documentation is displayed on the right panel served locally. To view docs smoothly, install the `"Live Preview"` extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server).

> Production version 0.2.8 does not connect to the latest VSCode versions. See notes for [v0.3.5 Alpha](./v0.3.5.md) which is now in testing. Stability has not yet been determined.

## Intellisense

![Control Actions](./images/code-intellisense.gif)

This extension provides basic intellisense for `app`, `ui` and `MUI` scopes. You can also hover to any `app`, `MUI` and `ui` methods to display a definition popup. Signature help is also provided so you can look at parameter names, types and descriptions while passing arguments to methods in each scope.

## Advanced Intellisense

Since version 2.3.0 you can use the integrated VSCode intellisense to help writing better code. To enable native type checks, right-click on a project in the project tree view and click `Enable Types`. This will add a `jsconfig.json` file to your project with a basic tslint configuration.

Initially you might see dozens of type errors in your source files. You can use the `Smart Declare Variables` feature by right-clicking on the project or a file in the vscode explorer, which then scans and automatically adds missing variable declarations on the fly. This should greatly reduce the remaining errors which you will have to address on your own.\
**Note:** SmartDeclare is based on regular expressions and doesnt have a structural understanding of your code. Use at your own risk. Simply undo the changes if the resulting changes are largely undesired.

## Best Practices

- Everytime you start editing your project, it is a good idea to reload the files to fetch any changes on the Project. Click the **Reload** button in the bottom of VS Code and select your desired action from the quickpick dialog.
- When you are working in VS Code, **DO NOT EDIT THE FILES IN THE WIFI IDE**.

## Known Issues

- Project doesnt automatically reload when replacing the root workspace folder
- Bottom action buttons are not initially shown
